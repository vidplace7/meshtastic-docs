The Meshtastic Team has been hard at work improving the Linux experience. We are excited to announce a number of new ways to use Meshtastic on Linux devices.
This includes support for more distributions and hardware options, as well as new features and improvements.

## <Icon icon="mdi:usb"/> USB Support

Meshtastic 2.5.18 introduced support for USB devices using the **CH341** chipset. Run Meshtastic straight from a typical computer with a simple USB adapter, no need for a dedicated device or Raspberry Pi.

This feature was made possible thanks to the [CH341 userspace driver](https://github.com/pine64/libch341-spi-userspace) developed by Pine64 and Jonathan Bennett. The driver is included in the `meshtasticd` package, so you can get started right away!

Special thanks to Mark Birss for designing the [MeshStick](https://github.com/markbirss/MESHSTICK) USB adapter, which was used for developing and testing this feature.

## New Platforms, New Possibilities

Meshtastic 2.5.20 brings support for additional Linux distributions and hardware platforms.

- <Icon icon="mdi:fedora"/> Fedora packages have been added via [Fedora COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/meshtastic/beta/).

- <Icon icon="mdi:ubuntu"/> Ubuntu packages have been added via [Canonical Launchpad (PPA)](https://launchpad.net/~meshtastic/+archive/ubuntu/beta).

- <Icon icon="mdi:debian"/> Debian and Raspbian packages have been overhauled to use [OpenSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/network:Meshtastic:beta/meshtasticd).

- <Icon icon="mdi:docker"/> Docker images for Debian and Alpine Linux are now available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/meshtastic/meshtastic).

These packages are provided for many architectures, depending on support from the distribution systems, including `x86_64`, `arm64`, `armhf` (Pi 2, Zero / Luckfox Pico) and more.
The architecture is automatically detected by the package manager, and selected depending on the system.

For more information about installing our packages on your system, refer to the [installation instructions](/docs/installation/linux/).
